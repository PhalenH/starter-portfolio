# starter-portfolio

## Description

This is the second iteration of my professional portfolio in addition to being my week 9 homework assignment for the fall part time full stack coding bootcamp. I replaced the stock images with no link with deployed pages of assignments and projects I've worked on during the first 8 weeks of the bootcamp.

## Technology Utilized

This portfolio will be based off HTML and CSS files as well as using bootstrap as a framework.\

Tools included in this portfolio:

* CSS variables
* flexbox
* media queries
* Bootstrap

## Objective

The objective is to create a responsive portfolio page that highlights my best work as a developer and provides insight to potential employers of the projects that I've worked on in the past and what I'm capable of as a web developer. Cheers!

<!-- TODO: add a screenshot of the portfolio and a link to the deployed portfolio -->
