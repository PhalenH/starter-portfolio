                Hello there and welcome to the first iteration of my professional portfolio. My name is Phalen Hazel and I am beginning my journey in becoming a web developer.
                After finishing highschool I pursued a career as a Physical Therapist Assistant and completed my studies at Central Penn College where I graduated in 2018; I've been working
                since 2019 in a skilled nursing facility where I'm still at currently. This setting and career has honed my time management and interpersonal skills, sharpened my ability to
                work in a high-stress and fast paced environment, and improved my capability to work either individually or as part of a team to ensure the best outcome for the patients we work with.
                Outside of work I enjoy traveling, keeping up with Philadelphia sport teams, and staying active through exercises and activities like yoga, hiking, and running. I hope to make a
                career change into web development after completing this course and through hard work, a great support system, and a challenging curriculum I believe it is possible. 
            </p>

                I hope to make a career change into web development after completing this course and through hard work, a great support system, and a challenging curriculum I believe it is possible.
                While it might not be much now, this portfolio will be filled with deployed projects that will be completed during my time in the full-stack bootcamp.
